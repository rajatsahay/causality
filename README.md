# causality

From my notes, this does not run on a Mac. Something to do with the way OpenCV is built for Macs. <br>
I haven't tried this on a Windows machine, but to use it with linux, you would have to build OpenCV from scratch rather than using ```pip``` or ```conda-forge```. <br>
<br>
The instructions can be found [here](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d2/de6/tutorial_py_setup_in_ubuntu.html).
